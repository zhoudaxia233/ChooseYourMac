### Storage Analysis
The listed sizes for all software are generally **much higher** than their fresh installation sizes. This is because the estimates take into account factors such as smooth operation, data caching, and other usage-related storage needs. These specific numbers are derived from various sources, including forum discussions and the official system requirements provided by the software developers.


### Memory Analysis
The performance estimates in this tool are based on Apple's **M-series** unified memory architecture. These values are *subjective approximations*, gathered from forums and YouTube analyses, and are not standardized measurements. They are for reference only and may vary depending on individual workloads.
