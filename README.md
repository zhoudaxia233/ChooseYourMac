### Storage Analysis
The listed sizes for all software are generally **much higher** than the initial installation sizes, as they account for smooth operation, caching, and usage-related storage needs. These specific numbers are derived from various sources, including forum discussions and the official system requirements provided by the software developers.


### Memory Analysis
The performance estimates are based on Apple's **M-series** unified memory architecture. These values are *subjective approximations*, gathered from forums and YouTube analyses, and are not standardized measurements.
